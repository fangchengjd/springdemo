 2. How to check port: see bootstrap log " Tomcat started on port(s): 8080 (http)"
 3. What is  context root: see bootstrap log "Mapping servlet: 'dispatcherServlet' to [/]"
 4. What is restful service url : see bootstrap log "Mapped "{[/greeting]}" onto public Greeting GreetingController.greeting(java.lang.String)"
