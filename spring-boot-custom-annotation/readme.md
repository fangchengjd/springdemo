 TBD GreetingControllerTests. Not run and not read it deeply.
 
 1. http://localhost:8080/greeting    wil return json   
    ```
    ??????
    ```
 2. How to check port: see bootstrap log " Tomcat started on port(s): 8080 (http)"
 3. What is  context root: see bootstrap log "Mapping servlet: 'dispatcherServlet' to [/]"
 4. What is restful service url : see bootstrap log "Mapped "{[/greeting]}" onto public Greeting GreetingController.greeting(java.lang.String)"
